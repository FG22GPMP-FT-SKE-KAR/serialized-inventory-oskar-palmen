I have followed the assignment and made a game where you can collect potions every 20 seconds by pressing the Spawn potion button. When pressed a potion shows up on screen and it gets added to the saved potion counter. You can use the potion by clicking on the potion. If you leave the game the potion gets saved in the counter. You can use the saved potion by pressing the use saved potion button. The game works on mobile. If you want to try the game you can play it on Android. You can find the game in the builds folder.
